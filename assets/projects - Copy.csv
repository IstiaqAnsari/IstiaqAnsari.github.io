Wearable Smart Neckband for Diet Monitoring;Diet monitoring is crucial for diseases such as: diabetes, obesity, eating disorders, hypertension. Automatic monitoring is more effective and accurate than manual count of intake. Developed a fabric-based low-cost ($5) wearable neckband that monitors user’s eating and drinking activities.;project neck band.PNG
Cardiovascular Screening with Heart Sounds;Cardiovascular diseases cause 31% of global deaths. Machine learning enabled stethoscopes can help in early diagnosis by detecting abnormal heart sounds. Proposed end-to-end Deep Learning framework consists of a Littmann stethoscope that connects to the server via an Android smartphone for real-time diagnosis.;project cardiovascular heart sound.PNG
End-to-End Sleep Staging with EEG;Sleep disorders are becoming a global health problem and more prominent in clinical practice as global population and life expectancy increases. Diagnosis of sleep disorders depend largely on the classification accuracy of sleep stages. We developed an end-to-end deep learning system for automatic sleep staging using a single channel EEG.;project eee sleep staging.jpg
Assistive Tele-Radiology System with Chest X-ray;Radiological imaging diagnosis plays an important role in clinical patient management. We aim to develop advanced deep learning models that can detect clinically important abnormalities from chest X-ray images. Developed system can be integrated within a tele-radiology framework for assisting a radiologist in making more efficient and effective diagnosis.;project chesh x-ray heat map.png
