Towards Domain Invariant Heart Sound Abnormality Detection using Learnable Filterbanks	Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Shabnam Gaffarzadegan, Md. Istiaq Ansari, Zhe Feng, Taufiq Hasan	IEEE JBHI, SEP 2019	domainInvHeartsound.png	We show that novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers that emulate different classes of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters can perform domain invariant heart sound abnormality detection.
Heart Sound Classification Considering Additive Noise and Convolutional Distortion	Farhat Binte Azam, Md. Istiaq Ansari, Taufiq Hasan	Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, JUNE 2021	cepsnet.jpg	Automatic analysis of heart sounds for abnormality detection is faced with the challenges of additive noise and sensor-dependent convolutional noise. In this work we analyze different feature combination of signal for classification task to understand the seprating both type of noise in an additive manner : additive noise in the frequency domain and convolutional noise in the log of frequency domain.
SpectNet : End-to-End Audio Signal Classification using Learnable Spectrogram Features	Md. Istiaq Ansari, Taufiq Hasan	IEEE TASLP (Under Review)	spectnet.png	In this work we design a module to extract spectrogram feature with custom frequency bins and let a model train on any type of audio signal. Also we analyze how much difference it make's if we let the model stocastically learn the center frequency for each filters for the domain it's trying to solve.
