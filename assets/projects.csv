Learnable MFCC layer for ene-to-end audio analysis	Designed a custom Pytorch Layer that can be integrated in any pytorch model to extract spectrogram feature with custom frequency bins and generate MFCC feature in and end-to-end fashion. The main goal is to make the filterbank stocastically learnable. This layer can speed up any work related to spectrogram/mfcc feature since one doesn't need to precompute the feature and the computation of the feature can be faster on the GPU cuda cores. This work is currently under revision at the IEEE-TASLP. 	../../assets/images/projects/frontend.png	Python, Keras, Pytorch, Matlab	https://github.com/IstiaqAnsari/SpectNet
Vein Pattern Extraction and Human Identification from Dorsal Hand Vein Images	Applied Image Processing Tools to extract vein features from hand images. Made a GUI Interface using MATLAB GUI to ease the process of extraction of the features.	../../assets/images/projects/vein_pattern.png	Python, Pytorch	https://github.com/IstiaqAnsari/Human-Identification-by-Hand-Vein-Pattern-Matching
Heart Rate Monitoring with Emotion Detection using PPG & GSR Sensors	Implemented a wireless device along with a PCB board to log the PPG and GSR data through Bluetooth. Estimated the heart rate from PPG signal through a dynamic HR model provided by DFT - based frequency analysis and careful Kalman Filter tuning. Extracted the SCL and SCR features of GSR signal applying SparseEDA algorithm to the processed data.

ECG Arrythmia Detection via Deep Neural Network	Main goal was early deteciton of ECG arrhythmia from a mobile device, via remote server connection to a deep learning arrythmia detection model. Experimented with the MIT-DB dataset, recorderd with 2 leads and annotated into 16 different arrythmia classes. 	../../assets/images/projects/ecg.png	Python, Pytorch, MATLB	https://github.com/IstiaqAnsari/ECG-Arrhythmia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
